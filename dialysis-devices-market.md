<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialysis Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis Dialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dialysis devices market is primarily categorized into two types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves using a machine to filter waste from the blood through an artificial kidney, often requiring sessions at a clinic or in-home setups. Peritoneal dialysis, on the other hand, utilizes the lining of the abdominal cavity as a filter, allowing for a more flexible, often at-home treatment option. Both approaches are essential for managing kidney failure, catering to diverse patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
