<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural fans market is primarily categorized into centrifugal and axial fans. Centrifugal fans generate airflow by converting rotational energy into pressure, making them ideal for ventilation in large spaces like barns and greenhouses. They can efficiently handle high resistance airflow. In contrast, axial fans propel air parallel to the fan's axis, offering high airflow rates with lower pressure, suitable for cooling and exhaust applications. Both types are essential for enhancing air circulation and maintaining optimal growing conditions in agriculture.</p></p>
